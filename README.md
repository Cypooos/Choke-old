# Choke-OS-old
A small project that took me 2 year to make. A test for me about how OS operate.

Work only on linux. Because makefiles. And coolness.

This is a OS. You can compiled + run it w/ QEMU using `make run`
You can clear using `make clear` and entirely clean it (removing .o files) using `make clean`

Yes. Nothing to talk about.
